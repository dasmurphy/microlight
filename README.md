microlighted.js
===============

*mcirolighted.js* is a fork of *microlight.js*

--

*microlighted.js* is a small library which improves readability of code snippets by highlighting, for any programming language, without attaching additional language packages.

Differences from original library include more detection of other things like numbers, hex, html tokens and more. It is based on css styles and not on inline style in the html code.

--

This is a work in progress version of restructuring the library.
