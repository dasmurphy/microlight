microlighted.js
===============

*mcirolighted.js* is derived from *microlight.js*

*microlighted.js* is a tiny library which improves readability of
code snippets by highlighting, for any programming language,
without attaching additional language packages.

Differences include more detection of other things like numbers,
hex, html tokens and more. It is based on css styles and not
more on style tags in the html code.
